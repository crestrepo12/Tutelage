## Description

Tutelage is a web application that allows individuals to find mentorship in a career field of their choosing from experienced experts.

## How does it work?

Tutelage works by allowing a "mentor" and a "mentee" to sign up for their accounts, respectively. Utilizing a matching algorithm, a mentee is paired with an ideal mentor to form a long-term, professional, mentoring relationship that will enrich the mentee's career path.
